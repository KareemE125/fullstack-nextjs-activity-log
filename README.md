## Description
    Events contain information relevant to actions taken by users in the application. 
    For example, when a user logs in, we use the system to create a new login_succeeded event.
    We can add information about the actor, action, target, date, etc.

    We can list, filter and search the acvtivty logs and go live for live view of ongoing logs, as well can create some :)

# Next.js
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
